        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence" target="_blank">Human intelligence</a> refers to
            the cognitive abilities of humans to learn from experience, adapt to new situations,
            understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one's environment. It encompasses a
            wide
            range of mental capacities including reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, language, and
            self-awareness.
            These capabilities enable individuals to acquire and apply knowledge, engage in social behavior, and build
            cultures.
        </p>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>
            The study of human intelligence dates back to ancient times, with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle
            exploring the nature of knowledge and reasoning.
            In the 19th and early 20th centuries, psychologists such as Alfred Binet and Charles Spearman began to
            formalize the measurement of intelligence,
            leading to the development of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"
                target="_blank">IQ tests</a>.
            Spearman proposed the concept of a general intelligence factor, or "g factor", which underlies all cognitive
            performance.

            In the mid-20th century, psychologists expanded the understanding of intelligence beyond a single score.
            Howard Gardner introduced the theory of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences" target="_blank">multiple
                intelligences</a>,
            suggesting that intelligence is not a single general ability but a collection of distinct types, such as
            linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, and interpersonal intelligence.
            Robert Sternberg also proposed a triarchic theory of intelligence, involving analytical, creative, and
            practical components.

            Ongoing research in neuroscience, psychology, and genetics continues to deepen our understanding of how
            intelligence develops,
            how it is influenced by environment and heredity, and how it can be assessed.

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding human intelligence has significant implications across various fields:

            <strong>Education:</strong> Insights into cognitive development help educators tailor instruction to
            individual learning styles and needs.
            Educational psychology uses knowledge of intelligence to design curricula and assessments that support
            student growth.

            <strong>Psychology:</strong> Intelligence research informs the diagnosis and treatment of learning
            disabilities,
            cognitive disorders, and developmental challenges. It also supports therapeutic strategies to improve mental
            performance and adaptability.

            <strong>Workplace and Industry:</strong> Cognitive testing is used in employee selection, training, and
            performance evaluation.
            Understanding how individuals process information aids in team building,
