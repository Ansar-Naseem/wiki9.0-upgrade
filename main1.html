        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">Artificial intelligence</a>
            (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, particularly computer
            systems. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities such as
            reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Subfields of AI include
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">natural language
                processing</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics" target="_blank">robotics</a>, and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision" target="_blank">computer vision</a>.

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>
            The idea of artificial intelligence dates back to antiquity, with myths of intelligent automatons appearing
            in Greek and other ancient cultures. However, the formal development of AI as a field began in the mid-20th
            century. In 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>
            proposed the concept of a machine that could simulate any human intelligence
            task, introducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing Test</a> as
            a measure of machine intelligence.

            In 1956, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop" target="_blank">Dartmouth
                Conference</a>â€”organized by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" target="_blank">John
                McCarthy</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" target="_blank">Marvin Minsky</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Rochester" target="_blank">Nathaniel Rochester</a>, and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" target="_blank">Claude Shannon</a>â€”coined the term
            "Artificial Intelligence" and is widely considered the founding moment of AI as
            an academic discipline. Early research focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving. The field
            experienced
            cycles of optimism and disillusionment, known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter"
                target="_blank">AI winters</a>", due to limitations in computing power and
            data.

            The resurgence of AI in the 21st century was fueled by advances in computational resources, the availability
            of large datasets, and breakthroughs in machine learning, especially <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank">deep learning</a> techniques. This
            led
            to significant progress in areas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition"
                target="_blank">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision"
                target="_blank">image recognition</a>,
            game playing, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot" target="_blank">autonomous
                systems</a>.

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence has become an integral part of many industries and everyday technologies:

            <strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI assists in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"
                target="_blank">medical diagnostics</a>, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery. Machine
            learning models can detect patterns in imaging data to aid radiologists and predict patient outcomes.

            <strong>Finance:</strong> Used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading"
                target="_blank">algorithmic trading</a>, credit scoring, fraud detection, and risk assessment, AI helps
            financial institutions make faster and more accurate decisions.

            <strong>Transportation:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car"
                target="_blank">Autonomous vehicles</a> rely on AI for perception, decision-making, and control. AI also
            supports logistics optimization and traffic management systems.

            <strong>Retail and E-commerce:</strong> AI enhances user experience through recommendation systems, dynamic
            pricing,
            customer service chatbots, and inventory management.

            <strong>Education:</strong> Adaptive learning systems use AI to tailor content to individual student needs.
            AI is also
            used in grading, language tutoring, and learning analytics.

            <strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Applications include virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa),
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation" target="_blank">machine translation</a>,
            sentiment analysis, and summarization tools.

            <strong>Entertainment and Media:</strong> AI is employed in content recommendation (e.g., <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify" target="_blank">Spotify</a>), video game
            design, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_art" target="_blank">AI-generated
                art</a> and music.
